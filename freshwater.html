												<h4>Novel : Fresh Water</h4>
												<br>
												<p style="margin-right: 1px;">Ada, whose christened name means “the egg of a python,” is born on June 6 to parents Saachi and Saul in Umuahia, Nigeria. Within Ada’s body are ogbanje, children of the gods. Children born with ogbanje often don’t survive infancy; against the odds, Ada lives, but it is clear that she is going to go mad. In her childhood, Ada is violent: she screams and is moody. Rather than crawl, toddler Ada slithers like a serpent. When she is three, she encounters a python in the bathroom. Saul takes a machete and hacks the python to bits, but he has enacted a sacrifice that will keep Ada’s physical body alive while her interior self fractures into pieces. As Ada grows up, she has nightmares, sensing the presence of the ogbanje. One December, as Ada celebrates the New Year, she is dancing at a masquerade ceremony when the ogbanje awaken and inhabit both the realm of the spirits and the realm of the physical world. As they realize that they are gods contained within a human body, they express unhappiness at being contained within a mortal form when they themselves are immortal.</p>
