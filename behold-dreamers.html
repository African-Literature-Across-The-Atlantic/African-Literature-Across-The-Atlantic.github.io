												<h4>Novel : Behold the Dreamers</h4>
												<br>
												<p style="margin-right: 300px;">Jende Jonga enters Clark Edwards’s office at the renowned investment bank, Lehman Brothers, to interview for a job as a chauffeur. Jende gets the job, which pays thirty-five thousand dollars per year—far more than he earned when he was working as a dishwasher or driving livery cabs in the Bronx during his first couple of years in New York. Jende has been living in the United States since 2004, when he obtained a three-month visitor’s visa from the U.S. embassy in his native Cameroon, with the intention of getting a green card. In his first two years in the U.S., living as an undocumented immigrant, Jende saves up enough money to bring over his girlfriend, Neni, on a student visa, along with their son, Liomi, in 2006. That same year, he and Neni marry. Jende and Neni are grateful to be in America, where they feel that they have something to look forward to each day. With the help of his attorney, Bubakar, Jende applies for asylum. Bubakar assures him that his prospects of getting it will be good, despite the cockamamie story that he instructs Jende to tell about Neni’s father trying to kill him.</p>
