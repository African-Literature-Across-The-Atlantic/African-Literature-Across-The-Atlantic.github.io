The two parallel journeys he embarked on, the material and textual, are mobilized by an interest in contemporary Brazil that this narrative incursion in geography and history allows us to find. Its course is guided by the desire to gauge the pulse of São Francisco, cutting through the lands that gained legendary status in the texts of Euclides da Cunha and Guimarães Rosa.</p>
