												<h4>Novel : Knots</h4>
												<br>
												<p style="margin-right: 300px;">Called "one of the most sophisticated voices in modern fiction" (The New York Review of Books), Nuruddin Farah is widely recognized as a literary genius. He proves it yet again with Knots, the story of a woman who returns to her roots and discovers much more than herself. Born in Somalia but raised in North America, Cambara flees a failed marriage by traveling to Mogadishu. And there, amid the devastation and brutality, she finds that her most unlikely ambitions begin to seem possible. Conjuring the unforgettable extremes of a fractured Muslim culture and the wayward Somali state through the eyes of a strong, compelling heroine, Knots is another Farah masterwork.</p>

											<p style="margin-left: 260px; margin-right: 30px">He was widely considered the most significant Somali writer in any European language. The son of a merchant and the well-known Somali poet Aleeli Faduma, Farah was educated in Ethiopia and at the colonial-era Institutio Magistrale in Mogadishu. Although his primary languages were Somali, Amharic, and Arabic, he also learned English and some Italian. His decision to write in English, chiefly a matter of the typewriter available to him, eventually gave him an international audience. After working for the Ministry of Education, he studied literature and philosophy at Panjab University in Chandigarh, India. There he wrote his first full-fledged novel, From a Crooked Rib (1970). It portrayed the determination of one woman to maintain her dignity in a society that believes “God created Woman from a crooked rib; and anyone who trieth to straighten it, breaketh it”; it was the first of Farah’s feminist works.</p>
