          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            Starting in the 1990s, restrictive immigration policies in European
            countries changed migration flows and made the Americas more
            attractive for African immigrants. Statistics show that the number
            of African immigrants in the Americas has grown rapidly. In the last
            15 years, Africans have shown the fastest growth rate among Black
            immigrant groups in the US. In Canada, Africa now ranks second as a
            source continent of recent immigrants. In Brazil, Africans represent
            65 percent of all asylum seekers, according to Brazil’s National
            Committee for Refugees (Conare). Many of Africa’s most acclaimed
            writers such as Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, and Chimamanda N.
            Adichie have lived in the Americas in order to escape persecution,
            pursue higher education, or benefit from job mobility. As such, the
            themes of exile and migration often find their way into their work,
            resulting in a blend of biographical and fictional itineraries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering migration to the Americas as an important theme in
            contemporary African fiction, this digital StoryMap aims to explore
            and visualize transatlantic migration in African literature through
            a computing and cartographic approach with the goal of mapping and
            performing distant readings of texts that deal with migration to
            Brazil, Canada, and the US – the three most prominent destinations
            in African literature. The texts featured in this map are written by
            authors from across the African continent and published between 1990
            and 2022 in English, French, Portuguese, and Arabic, thus overriding
            the limiting compartmentalization of African Studies divided by
            language.
          </p>
          <p id="team">
            By mapping geographic and sociological data collected from a large
            number of novels, this StoryMap will reveal the multi-sited nature
            of African writing produced by flows and circulations as well as the
            multidimensional experience of migration – voluntary or involuntary;
            direct or indirect. In doing this, this map will contribute to the
            decolonization of the Digital Humanities (DH) by applying its tools
            to African Studies.
