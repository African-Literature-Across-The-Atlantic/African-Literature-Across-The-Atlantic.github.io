            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
              Starting in the 1990s, restrictive immigration policies in
              European countries changed migration flows and made the Americas
              more attractive for African immigrants. Statistics show that the
              number of African immigrants in the Americas has grown rapidly. In
              the last 15 years, Africans have shown the fastest growth rate
              among Black immigrant groups in the US. In Canada, Africa now
              ranks second as a source continent of recent immigrants. In
              Brazil, Africans represent 65 percent of all asylum seekers,
              according to Brazil’s National Committee for Refugees (Conare).
              Many of Africa’s most acclaimed writers such as Wole Soyinka,
              Chinua Achebe, and Chimamanda N. Adichie have lived in the
              Americas in order to escape persecution, pursue higher education,
              or benefit from job mobility. As such, the themes of exile and
              migration often find their way into their work, resulting in a
              blend of biographical and fictional itineraries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Considering migration to the Americas as an important theme in
              contemporary African fiction, this digital StoryMap aims to
              explore and visualize transatlantic migration in African
              literature through a computing and cartographic approach with the
              goal of mapping and performing distant readings of texts that deal
              with migration to Brazil, Canada, and the US – the three most
              prominent destinations in African literature. The texts featured
              in this map are written by authors from across the African
              continent and published between 1990 and 2022 in English, French,
              Portuguese, and Arabic, thus overriding the limiting
              compartmentalization of African Studies divided by language.
            </p>
            <p id="team">
              By mapping geographic and sociological data collected from a large
              number of novels, this StoryMap will reveal the multi-sited nature
              of African writing produced by flows and circulations as well as
              the multidimensional experience of migration – voluntary or
              involuntary; direct or indirect. In doing this, this map will
              contribute to the decolonization of the Digital Humanities (DH) by
              applying its tools to African Studies.

                  space, migration, and gender. She is the author of
                  Géo/Graphies postcoloniales. La Poétique de l’espace dans le
                  roman mauricien et sénégalais (WVT, 2013) and the co-editor of
                  Beyond the Postmodern: Space and Place for the Early 21st
                  Century (2015) and
                  Afrika-Raum-Literatur/Africa-Space-Literature (2014). Antje
                  has published special issues on science fiction in French,
                  literary transnationalism, and spatial approaches to
                  literature. Her most recent publications deal with the Black
                  Mediterranean, speculative fiction, and geographic
                  metafiction. Currently, she is working on her second
                  manuscript which reads novels from across the African
                  continent through the lens of transatlantic migration.
