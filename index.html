            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
              Many of Africa’s most acclaimed writers have lived in the
              Americas. Notable authors such as Nobel Prize Laureate Wole
              Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Nurrudin Farah, and
              Chimamanda N. Adichie have all taken this path in order to escape
              persecution, pursue higher education, or benefit from job
              mobility. The experience of exile and migration often finds its
              way into their work, resulting in a blend of biographical and
              fictional itineraries. Indeed, in recent years, migration to the
              Americas has become an important theme in contemporary African
              fiction. However, scholarship has yet to engage with it in a
              systematic way.
            </p>
            <p>
              African migration literature reflects “real” trends and patterns.
              Starting in the 1990s, restrictive immigration policies in
              European countries changed migration flows and made the Americas
              more attractive for African immigrants. Statistics show that the
              number of African immigrants in the Americas has grown rapidly. In
              the last 15 years, Africans have shown the fastest growth rate
              among Black immigrant groups in the US.<sup>1</sup> In Canada,
              Africa now ranks second as a source continent of recent
              immigrants.<sup>2</sup> In Brazil, Africans represent 65 percent
              of all asylum seekers, according to Brazil’s National Committee
              for Refugees (Conare).<sup>3</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              This project explores transatlantic migration in African
              literature with the goal of mapping and performing distant
              readings of texts that deal with migration to Brazil, Canada, and
              the US – the three most prominent destinations we have found in
              African literature.<sup>4</sup> While the entire project will
              eventually include 64 titles, so far we have mapped data from 25
              texts written by authors from across the African continent and
              published between 1990 and 2022 in English, French, Portuguese,
              and Arabic.<sup>5</sup> Research on African literatures rarely
              adopts such a pan-African perspective, as texts are most often
              studied in separate subfields: African, English, French, and
              Portuguese Studies. Our selection overrides this typical (and
              limiting) compartmentalization of African Studies divided by
              language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mapping geographic and sociological data collected from a larger
              number of novels is a powerful tool to uncover dynamics that would
              go unnoticed when closely reading only a few texts. It reveals the
              multi-sited nature of African writing produced by flows and
              circulations as well as the multidimensional experience of
              migration – voluntary or involuntary; direct or indirect.
              Moreover, we have started to draw preliminary conclusions in terms
              of migration corridors, clusters, flows, transit routes, and
              gender ratios. It is our hope that other scholars will build on
              this project and that this will, in turn, create new lines of
              inquiry that advance research in African migration literature and
              the African digital humanities.
