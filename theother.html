												<h4>Novel : The Other Americans</h4>
												<br>
												<p style="margin-right: 300px;">Late one spring night, Driss Guerraoui, a Moroccan immigrant in California, is killed by a speeding car. The repercussions of his death bring together a diverse cast of characters, from his daughter, a jazz composer, to a veteran from the Iraq war, or an undocumented witness whose fear of deportation prevents him from coming forward. As the characters tell their stories, the invisible connections that tie them together–even while they remain deeply divided by race, religion, or class–are slowly revealed. When the mystery of what happened to Driss Guerraoui unfolds, a family’s secrets are exposed, a town’s hypocrisies are faced, and love, in its messy and unpredictable forms, is born.</p>
